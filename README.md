# Calorie Expenditure Modeling using XGBoost

## Overview

This project aims to model calorie expenditure using XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm known for its efficiency and accuracy in regression tasks. The dataset used for this project is stored in a CSV file named `calories.csv`, containing user IDs and corresponding calorie counts. The XGBoost model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook named `XGBoost_model.ipynb`.

## Dataset

The dataset `calories.csv` consists of the following columns:

- `user_id`: Unique identifier for each user.
- `calorie_count`: Calorie expenditure for each user.

The dataset is used to train the XGBoost model to predict calorie expenditure based on user characteristics and other factors.

## Files

1. `XGBoost_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the XGBoost model. The notebook includes the following sections:
   - Data loading and preprocessing.
   - Feature engineering.
   - Model training using XGBoost.
   - Model evaluation and validation.
   - Prediction of calorie expenditure.

2. `calories.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset with user IDs and calorie counts.

## Installation and Setup

To run the Jupyter Notebook and train the XGBoost model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/calorie-expenditure-model.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd calorie-expenditure-model
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib xgboost jupyterlab
    ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```

5. Open the `XGBoost_model.ipynb` notebook in your browser and execute each cell to train the model and make predictions.

## Usage

1. Load the dataset `calories.csv` into the notebook.
2. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the XGBoost model, and make predictions.
3. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations.
4. Use the trained model to predict calorie expenditure for new users or scenarios.
