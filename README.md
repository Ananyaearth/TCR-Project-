# Calorie Expenditure Modeling using XGBoost

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict calorie expenditure based on various factors such as physical activity, age, gender, weight, and heart rate using XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm. Calorie expenditure prediction is essential for fitness monitoring, weight management, and personalized fitness recommendations.

## Features

- Utilizes XGBoost algorithm for accurate calorie expenditure prediction.
- Integrates various input features including physical activity levels, age, gender, weight, and heart rate.
- Provides insights into factors influencing calorie expenditure and helps in optimizing fitness routines.
- Allows for real-time calorie expenditure estimation for individuals during physical activities.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Ananyaearth/TCR-Project-.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the calorie expenditure model should contain features such as physical activity levels, age, gender, weight, heart rate, and corresponding calorie expenditure measurements. Ensure the dataset is properly preprocessed and formatted before training the model.

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset: Ensure the dataset is formatted correctly with appropriate features and labels (calorie expenditure).
   
2. Train the model: Use the provided dataset to train the XGBoost model by running the training script.

    ```
    python train_model.py
    ```

3. Evaluate model performance: Evaluate the trained model's performance using relevant metrics and validation data.

4. Predict calorie expenditure: Utilize the trained model to predict calorie expenditure for new data points or real-time inputs.

    ```
    python predict_calorie_expenditure.py
    ```

## Model Tuning

Experiment with hyperparameters tuning and feature selection to optimize model performance. Adjust XGBoost parameters such as learning rate, maximum depth, number of estimators, and regularization parameters for better results.
